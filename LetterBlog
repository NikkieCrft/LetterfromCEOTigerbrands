  <h1><b>Apology and Commitment: Purity Essentials Baby Powder Recall</b></h1>
<div class="w3-row">
<h2>Dear Valued Customers, </h2>
<p>Today, I write to you with a profound sense of responsibility as the CEO of Tiger Brands, and <em><b>sincerely apologize for the recent Purity Essentials Powder Product recall.</b></em> Your trust and confidence in our products have been the driving force behind our unwavering commitment to excellence for years, and we are deeply sorry for the inconvenience and distress that this recall may have caused you and your loved ones. </P>

<p><b>The Safety and well-being of your little ones is our top priority</b>, and it was for this reason that we decided to immediately recall Purity essentials powder after discovering trace levels of asbestos in test samples from a batch of pharmaceutical-grade talc powder used as a raw material in the production of our finished Purity Essentials Powder Product. This batch of raw material, fell short of our commitment to the highest standards of quality and therefore necessitated a precautionary recall. </p>

<p>We understand the gravity of this situation and the impact it has on you, your family, and your confidence in our brand. As a company, we value integrity, transparency, and accountability above all else. Our actions today align to these core values. I can assure you that we are taking immediate and decisive steps to rectify the situation and I wish to assure you that your safety remains our top priority. We have initiated a comprehensive investigation to identify the root cause of this incident and are working closely with regulatory authorities and independent experts to implement measures that will prevent any reoccurrence. </p>

<p> <em><b>The recall is limited to the 100g, 200g, and 400g pack sizes of Purity Essentials Baby Powder.</b></em> Our Purity Essentials Baby Cornstarch Powder and all other Baby Care products under the Purity brand are not affected. We kindly request that you return your Purity Essentials Baby Powder products with the flagged barcode to your nearest supermarket, wholesaler, or pharmacy outlet. In doing so you will receive an immediate cash refund. </p>

Our dedicated consumer careline is available at <b>0860 004 755</b>Alternatively, you can reach us via email at <b>tigercsd@tigerbrands.com </b> Our customer care team are committed to providing you with the information and support that you may need during this time. </p>
